                        <span class="number-point">1.</span>Attached are two reports covering the sighting of an unidentified flying object in the Timaru area, during the late evening of 31 January 1961. The sightings were made by Flying Officer Ragg and his Air Signaller Sergeant Cowan, from a Devon aircraft, whilst on a night cross country navigation training flight.

                    <p>
                        <span class="number-point">2.</span>There is no reason to doubt the veracity of the reports – both Ragg and Cowan are responsible aircrew members. Indeed perhaps the most unusual aspect of the case was their reticence in making known the ‘sighting’ on return to base for fear of possible ridicule; it was not until some days later that the matter came to official notice.

                    <p class="dear">
                        Sir,
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="number-point">1.</span>I have the honour to report that on the night of 31 Jan 61, I was engaged on a navigation exercise entailing a flight at 7000<span class="minutes">'</span> from Wigram to the Oamaru area, North to Conway river mouth, and back to base. The forecast for the route was clear skies and light winds, and this was the weather encountered throughout the exercise. A noticeable feature initially was the impressive sunset, and rather unusual light, up until approx. 2100 hours. As we approached our first turning point at Orari, my signaller Sgt Cowan, drew my attention to traffic ahead, approaching very swiftly and at approx our altitude. I was prepared to take avoiding action when I realised that the object had slowed, and as we watched, it appeared to however about 5<span class="hyphen">–</span>600 yards away, remaining there fully thirty seconds before moving off extremely quickly to the South-west. Nearing Waimate, 25 minutes later a further sighting was made of the object, this time a considerable distance to the west, but still in the area where it initially disappeared. The flight continued normally and without further incident back to Wigram.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="number-point">2.</span>The first sighting of the U.F.O was at 2054M, and at this time the ground below was blanketed in near darkness, while above, a broad, bright orange band behind the hills, the sky was quite light. The object approaching was a dark silouette <span class="light"><span class="brackets">[</span><span class="italic">SIC</span><span class="brackets">]</span></span> and was at first, obviously moving towards us very quickly indeed. The rate of growing then became difficult to discern before we realised it had stopped right in front of us. There were no lights to be seen on the object, and although the shape of it was obvious, its edges were not sharply defined. It was basically cigar shaped with a convex protrusion sited centrally on top. At one stage there appeared to be a two legged ‘undercarriage’ attached in down position. A short period of time elapsed, during which we did not appear to gain on the object, and then it moved a short distance to the west before accelerating at a phenomenal rate to the S.W., maintinaing [SIC] straight and level until well over the hills and almost out of sight, when it again moved west, this time apparently losing altitude. During the second sighting, the object ‘flew’ three different headings before disappearing again and was probably at a lower altitude. At no stage did it appear to bank, and changes in direction were effected instantly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="number-point">3.</span>The length of time allowed for our observations was sufficient to enable us to discuss the possible nature of the subject. My first thought as I prepared to take evasive action was of a DC3 although this was quickly discounted. Sgt Cowan and myself discussed the possibility of meteorological phenomena, Canberra, foreign body on our aircraft, or reflections, and both noted the time of sighting. We closed our eyes, looked away and back again, moved our heads, and I moved the aircraft slightly from our course while the objects remained apparently motionless ahead. I was about to call a Devon following 2 – 3 minutes behind me when the object moved off, so I abandoned the call intending to mention the incident on completion of the exercise, however I concluded that the object was definitely solid, and did not exhibit conventional flight characteristics.

                    <p>
                        <span class="number-point">2.</span>My own observations concur with those of Fg Off Ragg in that I originally thought the object was an aircraft on a collison <span class="light"><span class="brackets">[</span><span class="italic">SIC</span><span class="brackets">]</span></span> course and reported this information to the Captain. Events the followed as detailed in Fg Off Ragg’s report.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="number-point">3.</span>I would definitely state that the object seen was under positive control and capable of extremely rapid course changes without deviating from straight and level flight. It appeared to be about the size of a DC<span class="hyphen">–</span>3 but cigar shaped with a small cockpit in a central position on the top surface. Although silhouetted against a bright evening sky the outline was not clearly defined but slightly distorted around the edges. On arrival back at base the incident was mentioned by one of the other Devon crews who attached no significance to the sighting. I feel I cannot add any further information than that given in FG Off Ragg’s report.

However, a few moments later they could no longer see the aircraft and because of the falling night and distance involved they thought nothing further of it.
