                    <p class="indent">
                        I am writing, as requested, to inform you of my sightings of the UFO’s over Palmerston North on Thursday. I am a member of the band <span class="strikethough">Redacted Name</span> who all saw the UFO’s.
                    </p>
                    <p class="indent">
                        At approximately 10<span class="time-colon">:</span>30<span class="smallcaps">PM</span> on Thursday night we left the Lounge Bar of the Albert Motor Lodge to return to our accommodation. While crossing the carpark <span class="brackets">(</span>cnr Main<span class="forward-slash">/</span>Albert<span class="brackets">)</span> we noticed an ‘orange ball’ in the sky, which we later estimated at roughly 5,000ft high, and about 45<span class="degree">º</span> up from us. The ball moved quite rapidly, considering its size, from a northerly to a SSE direction. At its closes point it gave the appearance that it was burning, as the edges seemed somewhat jaggered and constantly changing like fire. It also pulsated from very pale to darker orange.
                    </p>
                    <p class="indent">
                        As the object got further to the south, it ‘appeared’ to send off showers of red sparks at 10<span class="hyphen">–</span>15 second intervals. This may have been atmospheric conditions. Also on two or three occasions, as it headed away, it appeared to dip and move from side to side very rapidly, and without the normal turning room a plane would need. It would move and return to its continuous line in a matter of one second or less.
                    </p>
                    <p class="indent">
                        This object was in our view for 5<span class="hyphen">–</span>7 minutes at a guess, before becoming too distant to see with the naked eye. We then decided to return home, but as we turned around, we saw three similar objects, in a shallow V formation, in approximately the same position we saw the first. The three moved and looked the same as the first, but tended to move to a slightly more easterly direction. None of the objects made any sound that we could directly relate to them, there was the odd swishing sound, but it wasn’t constant, so was probably traffic in the city.
                    </p>
                    <p class="indent">
                        Before the three were out of sight, myself, <span class="strikethrough">Redacted Name</span> and a <span class="strikethrough">Redacted Name</span> who was staying at the Albert went to the reception and rang Ohakea, who told us to ring Palmerston North Airport, but there was no reply. The police were no help, so we rang Ohakea again, but didn’t get very far. So <span class="strikethrough">Redacted Name</span> tried and eventually got through to someone in charge.

                        If you should require any further information please contact our base address, <span class="strikethrough">Redacted Information</span> Wanganui.

                    <p>
                        <span class="number-point">1.</span>On 26th April 1979, I was the Duty Operations Officer for RNZAF OHAKEA. Whist at home, on call, I was contacted by the Ohakea telephone operator, who, at 2255 hours, informed that she had been contacted by several residents of PALMERSTON NORTH, who were enquiring about the ‘orange lights’ that were traversing the city. One such caller a <span class="strikethrough">Redacted Name</span> was put through to me. He stated that he, and several others, had observed coloured lights travelling from north to south above the city. I asked him to submit a written report to the Base Commanding Officer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="number-point">2.</span>Shortly afterwards, whilst I was exercising my dog in Featherston Street, I observed a single orange light, approaching from the north north east, and at about fifteen degrees above the horizon. Being a single light source, it was difficult to estimate range, but I assessed it to be about eight kilometres away and tracking along the watershed of the northern TARARUA Range. The weather was calm, clear and cold but it is unlikely if any noise would have been heard at that range.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="number-point">3.</span>As my family and I had observed an aerial phenomenon in the evening of 20th April, I was anxious to find witnesses of this sighting. Across the road, two youths were operating a C.B. radio. I asked them to confirm the sighting, and for their names and addresses. These are included in the Appendix.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="number-point">4.</span>At 2305 hours, I arrived back at my house. In transit, the lighted disc had been observed against a moving background, but he impression was gained that its track curved from south south west to south east. For two or three minutes, my family and I observed the now stationary disc, still at an elevation of about fifteen degrees and at a range of about fifteen kilometres. With the aid of 8×30 binoculars it was possible to make out the disc shape of yellow light, surrounded by thin corona of red light.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="number-point">5.</span>At 2307 hours, the size of the distant disc grew smaller, giving the impression of a rapid climb, directly away from these four observers on a heading of 130 degrees True, and with an angle of climb of 25 degrees, until it disappeared into the background of stars.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="number-point">6.</span>I then rang the WELLINGTON Air Traffic Control Centre, and spoke with the duty radar operator. He was informed of the sighting and informed me that he had neither known traffic nor unidentified blip in the area to the south east of Palmerston North. The Defence Duty Staff Officer was next informed of the sighting, with the coincidence of the last point of observation being identical to that sighting of the 20th April.

The disc had passed overhead of the observer and his two companions, who were standing in the north forecourt of the ALBERT Motor Lodge, Albert Street, Palmerston North. As it did so, at an estimated five to eight thousand feet, a pulsating swishing noise was heard. It was not thought that this could be mistaken for traffic noise. As the disc passed to the south, it was observed to emit sparks, which remained incandescent until they fell from sight behind the immediate horizon. The disc disappeared from sight in a like manner. The course of this first disc appeared to be erratic about south south east.

These flew on a course of approximately SSE, overflying from the north. These too, disappeared from sight behind the local horizon. Again, <span class="strikethrough">Redacted Name</span> was asked to submit a report in writing to the Base Commander.

He rang to confirm that he had spoken with Allin. He advised that he had been radar operator prior to and during Allin’s observations and that he had not observed any unusual sightings at that time or any other time during the evening <span class="brackets">(</span>other than normal traffic<span class="brackets">)</span>. He did observe, though, that WN Radar was not renown for its reliability and that it would not be capable of picking up an object at 4000’ over Palmerston North. The report in the ACC log confirms Allin’s verbal report. I advised Moyes that a written report was not required. Note: Moyes in conversation made the comment that he considered UFO phenomena do exist and that a scientific survey should be set up!
