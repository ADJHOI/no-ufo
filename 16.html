                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="number-point">1.</span>Captain Randle was the Captain of a SAFE Argosy that took off from Woodbourne 22 Dec 78 at 0110 for a Woodbourne, Christchurch, Auckland, Woodbourne flight.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="number-point">2.</span>When going on duty at about midnight he observed what could have been two vehicles on the hills towards the Cape Campbell direction moving in a northerly direction. He thought these could be two landrovers driving fairly fast over very rough terrain. He makes this observation because of the light beams described by the Woodbourne Orderly Officer and Mr Frame.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="number-point">3.</span>At 0159 on the south-bound leg to the Christchurch with Christchurch visible from Cape Campbell and a clear sky he was asked by Wellington radar to check the Clarence River area because Wellington were receiving radar returns from that area. He observed some lights at low level that could possibly have been in the Clarence area. When the aircraft was about 30 miles north the lights appeared to go out or disappear.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="number-point">4.</span>From Kaikoura east the aircraft plotted on radar a large vessel 17 miles northeast of Motunau about seven miles off the coast. The crew had visual contact with a ships <span class="light"><span class="brackets">[</span><span class="italic">SIC</span><span class="brackets">]</span></span> lights in that position. However Captain Randle estimates that for the size of the radar return the ship must have been fairly large <span class="brackets">(</span>1,000 tons <span class="light"><span class="brackets">[</span><span class="italic">SIC</span><span class="brackets">]</span></span> or so<span class="brackets">)</span>, and he considered it unusual that such a large vessel would have been so close to the coast.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="number-point">5.</span>At 0406 enroute to Auckland from Christchurch Wellington Radar again requested that the Clarence river radar returns be checked. The aircraft captain confirmed that lights were visible in that area out to sea and he got the impression of the lights making a rectangular pattern at irregular frequency. The lights had a beam appearance rather than a point source appearance and seemed to ‘turn away’ rather than turn off. <span class="underline">One</span> light appeared to illuminate the surface and Captain Randle assesses that the source of the light could have been at about 1,000 feet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="number-point">6.</span>The Clarence returns were the only ones that Captain Randle was asked to look at.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="number-point">7.</span>Captain Randle has produced two sets of notes, one made during the flight and one afterwards proving his comment<span class="forward-slash">/</span>speculation about the incident.

                        <span class="number-point">1.</span>South-bound. Lights were seen close to shore which corresponded with Wellington radar returns at ranges of 30 plus miles. These were unusually bright for normal ground lights and in one case appeared to be lighting up the surface in the Kekerenge<span class="brackets">(</span>?<span class="brackets">)</span> district.

                        From inflight notes. My<span class="forward-slash">/</span>our sightings were most undramatic and while no accurate count was made, five modern, say Iroquois type helicopters could have produced the whole performance.

                        When the surface was briefly lit up, in both directions, the illumination was V<span class="forward-slash">/</span>V A<span class="forward-slash">/</span>C landing lights of about 750 watts stronger and consistent with a light of somewhere up to 2000 watts at about 1,000 feet. While all light sources were consistent with this assumed strength focussing effects could have produced apparent strength, but not surface floodlighting.

                    <p class="indent">
                        The ability of our weather radar to pick up surface ships is based against visual checks on Jap fishing boats during attempts to range, and pot them. It is always possible that Tom Hood has screwed up the gear a notch and this estimate is invalid.
                    </p>
                    <p class="indent">
                        A normal number of presumed fishing boat lights which did not give returns on our radar were seen. The vessels mentioned were unusual by virtue of their assumed tonnage and area and tracks. There was no other reason to consider them unusual. They were not inconsistent, taken together with a Russian whaling<span class="forward-slash">/</span>shipping fleet where the standard vessels are larger than the Jap <span class="brackets">(</span>I have not targeted a Russian size vessel with our radar, this is an assumption<span class="brackets">)</span>.

                    <p class="indent">
                        The only question with MY sightings is not how, for helicopters could easily have reproduced all radar and visual effects, but why. IE I don’t want to blame anyone Russiians <span class="light"><span class="brackets">[</span><span class="italic">SIC</span><span class="brackets">]</span></span> or RNZAF they both could, it is illogical to assume either would. The undramatic nature of my sightings does not mean that I have any doubts as to the validity of what others saw <span class="brackets">(</span>Pilots I mean<span class="brackets">)</span>. Just that I can’t comment on what I didn’t see.

                        <span class="number-point">2.</span>At 2350 hours Mr Uffindell saw what he initially considered to be the three lights of a Bristol Freighter airdraft <span class="light"><span class="brackets">[</span><span class="italic">SIC</span><span class="brackets">]</span></span> three to four miles away from Woodbourne on finals for the airfield. The lights did not get any closer he then checked the lights through binoculars and determined that they appeared to be going to Wellington northward. The lights appeared to move upward and around in rectangles. He observed the lights for about 50 minutes. The bearing from Woodbourne was about 080 degrees magnetic that is towards Cape Palliser. At one stage the lights appeared to ‘rush forward’. Over a period the light seemed to move northeast and then gradually faded. He describes the light’s appearance as looking like somebody spotlighting. There was no cloud in the sky. 
                    </p>

                        <span class="number-point">3.</span>The largest of the three lights was yellowish and the other two were white. They were initially observed beyond Cape Campbell and then moved north. They were about one inch apart when measure at arms length.

                    <p>
                        <span class="number-point">4.</span>Mr Frame in company with W<span class="forward-slash">/</span>O Uffindell observed the lights from the control tower balcony. He describes the three lights as having one bright orange and two other less intense lights. The large orange light appeared fairly stationary and the other two appeared to move north. A shaft appeared from the two white lights angling down at about 40 degrees in a northely <span class="light"><span class="brackets">[</span><span class="italic">SIC</span><span class="brackets">]</span></span> direction. Using binoculars apparently had no enlarging effect on the lights! Mr Frame notified ATC Wellington of his observations and was told by Wellington that they had five radar targets in the Clarence area. <span class="brackets">(</span>Apparently nothing to do with the Woodbourne sightings.<span class="brackets">)</span>

                        <span class="number-point">5.</span>The lights appeared to be slightly above the hills to the southeast of Blenheim and all but one disappeared over a period. One of the smaller lights was still visible when the Argosy took off about 0120 hours.

                    <p>
                        <span class="number-point">1.</span> Captain Powell with First Officer Pirie were the crew of a SAFE Argosy from Woodbourne to Christchurch and then Dunedin on 22 Dec 78. The aircraft departed Woodbourne at 0315 hours. The weather throughout the flight was good with a light north-easterly wind and cloud to the east of the South Island. There was no turbulence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="number-point">2.</span>At 0330 Wellington ATC asked the crew to investigate the Clarence River area for radar returns that Wellington was picking up. The aircraft crew did not observe any activity either on radar or visually. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="number-point">3.</span>At 0338 the crew were asked by Wellington Radar to identify a strong radar return that Wellington was receiving about 25 nautical miles to the port of the Argosy. Both the captain and the First Officer observed a very bright light which they variously described as bright orb<span class="forward-slash">/</span>pear shaped<span class="hyphen-2">—</span>reddish tinge then turned white. From the aircraft the object appeared to be stationary by visual observation however by radar the object appeared to ‘track the aircraft’. It appeared to be very  close<span class="hyphen-2">—</span>less than ten miles. <span class="brackets">(</span>Although the light was on the bearing indicated by the aircraft radar and apparently in the position described by Wellington Radar confirmation is necessary as to whether the light could in face have been at great distance bearing in mind the crew would have no backdrop to assess distances<span class="hyphen-2">—</span>query depth perception.<span class="brackets">)</span> The light passed behind it out of sight and radar contact. <span class="brackets">(</span>When the crew say the light tracked the aircraft confirmation is necessary that it was seen to move on radar because by visual observation it appeared stationary which in fact would indicate that the light was at a great distance from the aircraft.<span class="brackets">)</span> 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="number-point">4.</span>At 0400 when 50 miles northeast of Christchurch the Captain observed on the aircraft radar a return that approached the aircraft very rapidly and then veered off sharply to the aircraft’s left. During a period of about five seconds about five radar returns were received and in the space of that time the blips passed through a distance of some 15 miles on the radar range scale and then disappeared from the radar screen. <span class="brackets">(</span>10,000mph per hour!<span class="brackets">)</span> During this period the aircraft radar was also plotting ships near the coast. Simultaneously the First Officer observed a light he describes as being like a Boeing flashing strobe light which followed the same path as the radar returns. <span class="brackets">(</span>This episode above all others caused both aircrew mild consternation to say the least!<span class="brackets">)</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="number-point">5.</span>Captain Powell checked with Christchurch radar whether they had had any radar contacts but were advised that it was ‘not worth having the radar on’. <span class="brackets">(</span>Check whether Wellington radar observed anything.<span class="brackets">)</span>
